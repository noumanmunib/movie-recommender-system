Sure! Here's a sample `README.md` file you can use for your **Movie Recommender System** project that was built using **Streamlit**. This README will explain what the project is, how to run it locally, and any dependencies required (including `requirements.txt`).

---

# Movie Recommender System

This is a **Movie Recommender System** built using **Streamlit** that suggests movies based on a user's selection. The application leverages **cosine similarity** and data from **TMDb (The Movie Database)** API to recommend similar movies.

## Features
- User can select a movie from a dropdown list.
- The system recommends 5 movies similar to the selected movie.
- Each recommendation includes a poster fetched from the **TMDb API**.

## Demo

You can see a demo of the system here (link to your deployed app, if applicable, e.g., on Heroku, Vercel, or Streamlit Share).

## Screenshots

(Insert relevant screenshots here showing the application interface and the recommendation output.)

## Tech Stack

- **Streamlit**: Used for building the web interface.
- **TMDb API**: Used to fetch movie data and posters.
- **Python**: Core language for developing the application.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation.
- **Pickle**: To load precomputed data such as movie similarity matrix.

## How to Run the Project Locally

### Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- An IDE like PyCharm or VSCode
- A GitHub account (to clone the repository)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # On MacOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows
   ```

4. **Install the dependencies**:

   You can install all necessary packages by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Set up TMDb API key**:

   - Sign up for an API key at [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).
   - Add the API key to your code where necessary in the `fetch_poster` function.

6. **Run the Streamlit app**:

   After setting up everything, you can run the app using the following command:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   This will open the application in your browser.

7. **Enjoy the Movie Recommender System**!

### Requirements

The project uses the following libraries, which are listed in `requirements.txt`:

```
streamlit==<version>
pandas==<version>
requests==<version>
```

Make sure to include these libraries in the `requirements.txt` file so that anyone cloning the repository can easily install the required dependencies.

### Example `requirements.txt`

Here's an example of what your `requirements.txt` file might look like:

```
streamlit==1.4.0
pandas==1.3.3
requests==2.26.0
```

Make sure the versions align with what you're using in the project.

## File Structure

```bash
movie-recommender-system/

├── app.py                # Main Streamlit app
├── movies.pkl            # Movie dataset with similarity scores
├── similarity.pkl        # Similarity matrix for movies
├── requirements.txt      # Required packages
└── README.md             # This README file
```

## Future Improvements

- Add more advanced recommendation techniques (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering).
- Include additional movie data like genres, ratings, or cast information.
- Improve the UI/UX with more interactivity.
